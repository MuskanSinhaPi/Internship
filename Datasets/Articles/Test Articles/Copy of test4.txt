From rackets and shuttlecocks to the speed and skills of the game. A lot of things have changed throughout the years in badminton.

The sport is believed to be traced back more than 2000 years, but the modern version is said have been be invented in 1873 in Gloucestershire, England, by the Duke of Beaufort, who brought the game back from India.

In 1934, the IBF - now Badminton World Federation (BWF) - was established. It was 14 years later that the first international tournament, the Thomas Cup, took place. Badminton became an official Olympic sport in Barcelona in 1992.

What else has defined badminton? Here are some of the biggest changes in the sport over the last decades.

The badminton racket
The first badminton rackets were made of a single piece of wood and animals guts as strings. A piece of clothing was often wrapped around the handle to make it more comfortable.

Later, players began using lighter rackets of aluminium or steel, until carbon fibre revolutionised the way rackets were built in the 1950s.

The graphite composite rackets of today are light and allow control and power, while the strings are made of a variety of hybrid nylon.

The shuttlecock
Shuttlecocks have also gone through a big transformation. They were made from unrefined and unprocessed bird feathers in the beginning.

As the sport grew, the feathers became standardised. For a long time, geese feathers were used for international play and duck feathers for club play.

From 2021, natural feather shuttlecocks were replaced by synthetic ones in all the tournaments sanctioned by the Badminton World Federation.

The rules of badminton
Over the years, the rules of badminton have evolved. The scoring system saw a significant change in 2001. Up until then, the shuttlers played up to 15 points, where only the serving side could score points. Since the change, players compete in a rally point system up to 21 points, where a two-point lead is necessary to win a game.

In 1983, a rule was introduced that allowed players to serve overhead. However, it was changed again in 2006. Most players in the modern game prefer a short backhand serve or even a high-toss serve. The shuttlecock should be below the waist of the server when being hit.

The hawk-eye system was a revolutionary introduction in 2014, allowing players to challenge the linejudgeâ€™s decision by asking for a video review of the play.

Additionally, rules have been added to equipment and clothing, as well as the course surface that now is covered with a synthetic mat purposefully built for badminton
