The term “personal finance” refers to how you manage your money and plan for your future. All of your financial decisions and activities have an effect on your financial health. It’s always important to consider what we should be doing—in general—to help improve our financial health and habits. Here we discuss five broad personal finance rules that can help get you on track to achieving whatever your financial goals may be.
“Personal finance” is too often an intimidating term that causes people to avoid planning, which can lead to bad decisions and poor outcomes.
Take the time to budget your income vs. expenses, so you can spend within your means and manage lifestyle expectations.
Successful financial planning entails being mindful of spending regardless of your income level or of what you want but don't need.
By saving early, you capture more potential of compounding - investment growth on prior investment growth.
Always prioritize creating an emergency fund; you never know when something will come up.
Money comes in, money goes out. For many people this is about as deep as their understanding gets when it comes to personal finances. Rather than ignoring your finances and leaving them to chance, a bit of number crunching can help you evaluate your current financial health and determine how to reach your short- and long-term financial goals.
As a starting point, it is important to calculate your net worth—the difference between what you own and what you owe. To calculate your net worth, start by making a list of your assets (what you own) and your liabilities (what you owe). Then, subtract the liabilities from the assets to arrive at your net-worth figure.

Your net worth represents where you are financially at that moment, and it is normal for the figure to fluctuate over time. Calculating your net worth one time can be helpful, but the real value comes from making this calculation on a regular basis (at least yearly). Tracking your net worth over time allows you to evaluate your progress, highlight your successes, and identify areas requiring improvement.
Calculating a Personal Budget
Equally important is developing a personal budget or spending plan. Created on a monthly or an annual basis, a personal budget is an important financial tool because it can help you plan for future costs, reduce unnecessary spend, save for future goals, and prioritize where you put your money.
There are numerous approaches to creating a personal budget, but all involve making projections for income and expenses. The income and expense categories you include in your budget will depend on your situation and can change over time. Common income categories include:

Alimony
Bonuses
Child support
Disability benefits
Interest and dividends
Rents and royalties
Retirement income
Salaries/wages
Social security
Tips
General expense categories include:

Childcare/eldercare
Debt payments (car loan, student loan, credit card)
Education (tuition, daycare, books, supplies)
Entertainment and recreation (sports, hobbies, books, movies, DVDs, concerts, streaming services)
Food (groceries, dining out)
Giving (birthdays, holidays, charitable contributions)
Housing (mortgage or rent, maintenance)

Medical/Health Care (doctors, dentists, prescription medications, other known expenses)
