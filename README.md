This paper and approach was referred to for crime prediction on the San Francisco Crime dataset, however, owing to the low sparsity, the model's accuracy and predictive power was impacted.
<h3> STHSL </h3>
A pytorch implementation for the paper: [Spatial-Temporal Hypergraph Self-Supervised Learning for Crime Prediction](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9835423) in ICDE 2022.
Spatial-Temporal Hypergraph Self-Supervised Learning for Crime Prediction (STHSL) is a spatio-temporal prediction networks. By adding self-supervised learning methods as auxiliary tasks, STHSL can tackle the label scarcity issue in crime prediction.
